# DeepSea-AI Discovery Engine Implementation Progress

**Project:** DeepSea-AI Stage 2 - Discovery Engine  
**Start Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Current Status:** Planning & Setup Phase  
**Overall Progress:** 0% Complete  

---

## 📋 Implementation Overview

The Discovery Engine represents **Stage 2** of the DeepSea-AI pipeline, implementing unsupervised discovery of novel microbial taxa using:
- **Input:** ASV sequences from Stage 1 (DADA2 output)
- **AI Model:** DNABERT-S pre-trained genomic foundation model
- **Clustering:** HDBSCAN unsupervised clustering
- **Output:** Taxonomic cluster assignments for potential novel species discovery

### Pipeline Flow:
```
Stage 1: FASTQ → fastp → DADA2 → ASV Table ✅ (Completed)
Stage 2: ASV Table → DNABERT-S → Embeddings → HDBSCAN → Cluster IDs 🚧 (In Progress)
```
